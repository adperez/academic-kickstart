Through all of my experiences and training I have comfort teaching a wide breadth of psychological topics and courses such as: introduction to psychology, research methods, statistics, intervention psychology, social psychology, cultural psychology, personality psychology, positive psychology, and stigma and prejudice. Further, I have extensive experience being on the instructional team for a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and feel comfortable creating and teaching a course on an online platform.
